# AndroidDev and Compose
Some reminds in AndroidDev process

## Architecture Patterns
MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel): Separates concerns for better maintainability.

MVP (Model-View-Presenter): Another separation of concerns with a different flow.

- M: Represent Data and Logics of te application, handle data retrieval and storage
- V: UI component for displying data to user, could be Activity or Fragments
- VM: bridge, hold data and manage UI logic, lifecycle aware, can _survive configuration changes_(screen rotate)
- use databinding to update to automatically update view when VM change
- P: Preseter, more manually update than VM, does not come with Data binding


Clean Architecture: Organizes code into layers for easier testing and maintenance.

## Material Design in Android Dev
Key features of Material Design include:

### 1. Material Metaphor: This concept uses tactile surfaces and realistic lighting to create a sense of depth. Elements look and behave like physical materials, providing a familiar experience for users.
Example: To make a gradient background for app
```
@Composable
fun GradientBackground() {
    Box(
        modifier = Modifier
            .fillMaxSize()
            .background(
                brush = Brush.horizontalGradient( 
                    // use Brush.verticalGradeint to change the angle
                    colors = listOf(
                        Color(0xFF64B5F6), // Start color
                        Color(0xFF0D47A1)  // End color
                    )
                )
            )
    )
}
```

### 2. Typography: Bold, Graphic, and Intentional: It emphasizes bold colors, large typography, and intentional white space to create a visually appealing and easy-to-navigate interface.
Example:

Create a Font Resource Folder:

In your res directory, create a new folder named font if it doesn't already exist. Right-click on res, go to New > Android Resource Directory, select font as the Resource Type, and click OK.

Add Your Font File:

Place your .ttf or .otf font files into the res/font directory.
```
@Composable
fun Greeting(name: String) {
    // Create a FontFamily using the custom font
    val customFont = FontFamily(
        Font(R.font.your_custom_font) // Replace with your font file name
    )

    Text(
        text = name,
        fontSize = 24.sp,
        fontFamily = customFont // Apply the custom font
    )
}
```

### 3. Motion Provides Meaning: Animations are used to guide users, indicate actions, and provide feedback, enhancing the overall experience rather than distracting from it.
Example:
First to add animation dependency in build.gradle file
```
dependencies {
    implementation "androidx.compose.animation:animation:1.3.0"
    // Other dependencies
}
```
simple fade-in animation using Jetpack Compose:
```
@Composable
fun AnimatedContent() {
    val visible = remember { mutableStateOf(false) }

    Button(onClick = { visible.value = !visible.value }) {
        Text("Toggle Animation")
    }

    AnimatedVisibility(
        visible = visible.value,
        enter = fadeIn()
    ) {
        Text("Hello, Animated World!")
    }
}
```



### 4. Adaptive Design: Material Design promotes responsive and adaptive layouts that adjust to various screen sizes and orientations, ensuring a consistent experience across devices.
Example: LazyColumn
First set up dependencies:
```
dependencies {
    implementation "androidx.compose.ui:ui:1.3.0"
    implementation "androidx.compose.material3:material3:1.0.0"
    implementation "androidx.compose.ui:ui-tooling-preview:1.3.0"
    // Other dependencies
}
```
code for lazy column
```
@Composable
fun ItemList() {
    // Sample data
    val items = List(100) { "Item #$it" }

    LazyColumn(
        modifier = Modifier.fillMaxSize(),
        contentPadding = PaddingValues(16.dp)
    ) {
        items(items) { item ->
            ItemCard(item)
        }
    }
}

@Composable
fun ItemCard(item: String) {
    Card(
        modifier = Modifier
            .fillMaxWidth()
            .padding(vertical = 4.dp)
            .clickable { /* Handle click event */ },
        elevation = CardDefaults.elevation(4.dp)
    ) {
        Row(
            modifier = Modifier.padding(16.dp),
            verticalAlignment = Alignment.CenterVertically
        ) {
            Text(text = item, fontSize = 20.sp)
        }
    }
}
```
### 5. Components and Patterns: It includes a rich library of UI components and design patterns, making it easier for developers to create consistent and functional applications.
Example: Modifier

——————

## Basic Layout in Android Compose
Link: https://developer.android.com/develop/ui/compose/layouts/basics
Column
```
Column {
    Text("Item 1")
    Text("Item 2")
}
```

Row
```
Row {
    Text("Item 1")
    Text("Item 2")
}
```

Box
```
Box {
    Image(painterResource(R.drawable.image), contentDescription = null)
    Text("Overlay Text", modifier = Modifier.align(Alignment.Center))
}
```
check mark example:
```
@Composable
fun ArtistAvatar(artist: Artist) {
    Box {
        Image(bitmap = artist.image, contentDescription = "Artist image")
        Icon(Icons.Filled.Check, contentDescription = "Check mark")
    }
}
```

Modifier
```
Text("Hello", modifier = Modifier.padding(16.dp))
```

Spacer
```
Row {
    Text("Item 1")
    Spacer(modifier = Modifier.width(16.dp))
    Text("Item 2")
}

```

LazyColumn
```
LazyColumn {
    items(listOf("Item 1", "Item 2", "Item 3")) { item ->
        Text(item)
    }
}
```

Card
```
Card {
    Text("This is a card")
}
```

!!! Scaffold
1. Basic Layout Structure: Scaffold sets up the fundamental layout for your UI, including slots for the app bar, bottom navigation, floating action button, and the main content.

2. Top App Bar: You can easily add a TopAppBar to the scaffold, which is typically used for displaying the title of the screen and actions like search or settings.

3. Bottom Navigation: It allows you to include bottom navigation components, making it easy to switch between different sections of your app.

4. Floating Action Button (FAB): You can add a FAB that typically performs the primary action of the screen, such as adding a new item.

5. Content Area: The main content of the screen can be placed within the Scaffold, and it handles the padding automatically to accommodate the app bar, navigation bar, and FAB.
```
Scaffold(
    topBar = { TopAppBar(title = { Text("Title") }) },
    floatingActionButton = { FloatingActionButton(onClick = {}) { Icon(Icons.Filled.Add, contentDescription = null) } }
) { innerPadding ->
    // Content goes here
}
```
```
@Composable
fun MyApp() {
    MaterialTheme {
        Scaffold(
            topBar = {
                TopAppBar(
                    title = { Text("My App") },
                    actions = {
                        IconButton(onClick = { /* Handle action */ }) {
                            Icon(Icons.Default.Search, contentDescription = "Search")
                        }
                    }
                )
            },
            floatingActionButton = {
                FloatingActionButton(onClick = { /* Handle FAB click */ }) {
                    Icon(Icons.Default.Add, contentDescription = "Add")
                }
            }
        ) { paddingValues ->
            // Main content goes here
            // Use paddingValues to avoid content overlapping with top bar or FAB
            Text(
                text = "Hello, Scaffold!",
                modifier = Modifier.padding(paddingValues)
            )
        }
    }
}

```

### State Hoisting in Android
state hoisting is a concept borrowed from React, but it can be applied in various ways to manage state effectively in your apps. While Android doesn't have "state hoisting" as a formal term, you can achieve similar outcomes through proper architecture and component design.

1. ViewModel
Use the ViewModel class to store UI-related data in a lifecycle-conscious way. This allows data to survive configuration changes like screen rotations.
The ViewModel acts as a centralized place to hold the state of your UI, effectively "hoisting" it above the individual UI components.
```
class MyViewModel : ViewModel() {
    var myState: MutableLiveData<String> = MutableLiveData("Initial State")
}
```
2. LiveData
Use LiveData to observe changes in the state. When the data changes, any UI component observing this data will automatically update.
```
class MyActivity : AppCompatActivity() {
    private lateinit var viewModel: MyViewModel

    override fun onCreate(savedInstanceState: Bundle?) {
        super.onCreate(savedInstanceState)
        setContentView(R.layout.activity_main)

        viewModel = ViewModelProvider(this).get(MyViewModel::class.java)

        viewModel.myState.observe(this, Observer { newState ->
            // Update your UI based on the new state
        })
    }
}
```
3. Passing state down
For Child components (e.g., fragments or custom views) that need to use the state, pass the state down as parameters. This way, the state is managed in one place (the ViewModel), but it's accessible where needed.
```
class MyChildFragment : Fragment() {
    var state: String? = null

    fun updateState(newState: String) {
        state = newState
        // Update UI accordingly
    }
}
```
4. Avoid duplicate
By using a single ViewModel to manage your app's state, you avoid duplicating state across different fragments or activities. This reduces the chance of bugs arising from inconsistent state management.

### Fragments in Android (vs Activity) - Fragments 之间用handler交流
Link: https://youtube.com/watch?v=-vAI7RSPxOA&ab_channel=PhilippLackner
Link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-NcxT697Nk&ab_channel=Foxandroid

Fragments are modular sections of an (part of) Android activity that allow for more flexible UI design and navigation. They represent a portion of the user interface and can be thought of as sub-activities that have their own lifecycle and can be combined in various ways within an activity.
Modularity:

Fragments enable you to build reusable UI components that can be easily shared across different activities.
Lifecycle Management:

Fragments have their own lifecycle that is closely tied to the lifecycle of their hosting activity. They go through states like Created, Started, and Resumed.
Dynamic UI:

You can add, remove, or replace fragments at runtime, allowing for a flexible UI that can adapt to different screen sizes and orientations.
Back Stack Support:

Fragments can be added to the back stack, enabling users to navigate back through fragment transactions like they would with activities.
Communication:

Fragments can communicate with their hosting activity and with each other, typically through interfaces or shared ViewModels.


###  Internal state to a composable
In Jetpack Compose, you can manage internal state in a composable using the remember and mutableStateOf functions. 
```
import *

@Composable
fun Counter() {
    // Declare a mutable state variable for the count
    var count by remember { mutableStateOf(0) }

    // Layout for the counter
    Column(
        modifier = Modifier
            .fillMaxSize()
            .padding(16.dp),
        horizontalAlignment = Alignment.CenterHorizontally,
        verticalArrangement = Arrangement.Center
    ) {
        Text(text = "Count: $count", style = MaterialTheme.typography.headlineMedium)

        Row {
            Button(onClick = { count++ }) {
                Text("Increment")
            }
            Spacer(modifier = Modifier.width(8.dp))
            Button(onClick = { if (count > 0) count-- }) {
                Text("Decrement")
            }
        }
    }
}
```

### Internal state and State hoisting
Internal state:

Internal state refers to state that is contained and managed within a single composable. This state is local to that composable and is used to manage its own UI logic. The state is typically managed using remember and mutableStateOf.


State hoisting:

State hoisting is a design pattern in which the state is moved up to a parent composable, allowing child composables to receive the state as a parameter. This approach promotes a clear separation of concerns and allows for better state management, particularly when multiple composables need to share or react to the same state.

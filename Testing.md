## Espresso in Android
Google created the open-source Espresso testing framework for the Android user interface (UI). Espresso is an easy, efficient, and adaptable testing framework. Espresso tests avoid the distraction of boilerplate content, custom infrastructure, or complicated implementation details by stating expectations, interactions, and assertions in a straightforward and concise manner. Espresso tests execute really efficiently! It allows you to forego your waits, syncs, sleeps, and polls while manipulating and making assertions on the application UI while it is idle.

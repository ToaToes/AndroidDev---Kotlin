## What is Hilt and Dagger
Hilt and Dagger are libraries for dependency injection (DI) in Android development. They help manage dependencies in a clean, modular way, making your code more maintainable and testable.

### Dagger
Dagger is a compile-time dependency injection framework developed by Google. It allows you to define how objects are created and injected into classes, reducing boilerplate code and improving scalability.

Key Features of Dagger:
1. Compile-Time Validation: Dagger checks for dependency correctness at compile time, reducing runtime errors.
2. Performance: Being a compile-time framework, it generates optimized code, which can lead to better runtime performance.
3. Modularity: You can define and manage different scopes for your dependencies, like singleton or activity-scoped instances.

### Hilt
Hilt is built on top of Dagger and simplifies its usage specifically for Android applications. It provides a set of annotations and a more streamlined way to set up DI in Android projects.

Key Features of Hilt:
1. Simplified Setup: Hilt reduces the boilerplate code required for setting up Dagger. You don't need to create custom components and modules explicitly.
2. Android Integration: Hilt integrates seamlessly with Android components, such as Activities, Fragments, and ViewModels, making it easier to manage their lifecycles.
3. Built-in Scopes: Hilt provides predefined scopes (like @ActivityScoped, @FragmentScoped, and @Singleton) to manage dependencies easily based on Android component lifecycles.


### Why Use Hilt and Dagger?
Modularity and Separation of Concerns: DI promotes a cleaner architecture by separating the creation of objects from their usage. This modularity allows for easier testing and maintenance.

Improved Testability: With DI, you can easily swap implementations of your dependencies with mocks or stubs during testing, leading to more robust unit tests.

Lifecycle Management: Hilt automatically handles the lifecycle of dependencies, reducing the risk of memory leaks by ensuring dependencies are scoped appropriately to the lifecycle of Android components.

Reduced Boilerplate Code: Hilt reduces the amount of boilerplate code required to set up DI, making it easier and faster to implement compared to using Dagger directly.

Community Support and Best Practices: As a Google-supported library, Hilt aligns with modern Android development practices and is widely adopted, providing strong community support.
